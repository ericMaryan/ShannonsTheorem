# ShannonsTheorem
A program that is used to calculate Shannon's Theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem).

This program's GUI (Swing) allows the user to calulate Shannon's Theorem using any of the 3 different methods of input to perform the calculation. Using the Observer and Observable class, each section of the GUI gets updated to reflect the user's input. 

A graph is also present in the GUI that gets updated based on the user input. This graph was created using 
JFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/).
